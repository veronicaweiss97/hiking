                <p class="first__descr-text">There’s a reason why, for decades, the answer to all kinds of ailments has been to ‘walk it off’. Heading out into the great outdoors has been a widely accepted cure for all kinds of problems, from stress and anxiety, to feeling sluggish after an extra-large roast dinner.<br> But, unlike avoiding swimming within an hour of eating, this is no old wives’ tale. Walking outside really does actively benefit us – and there’s arguably no better way to engage in this ancient practice than to strap on your finest walking boots, grab some walking poles and head out on a hike. But what exactly are the benefits of hiking?</p>

                        <p class="two__content-cards-first-descr">One of the great things about regularly engaging in a spot of good exercise is the fact that the benefits are all-encompassing. This is particularly true when it comes to blood pressure and how healthy our hearts are – and it’s not surprising to hear that the health benefits of hiking don’t just include weight loss and a boost to fitness: it’s a fantastic way to lower blood pressure and the risk of heart disease as well as other serious conditions.</p>

And this is one of the great things about this activity; there is so much more than just a single benefit of hiking. Engaging in regular hiking can even make us more creative. </p>

                        <p class="two__content-cards-three-descr">While there’s plenty of evidence to support the argument that hiking can help prevent all kinds of health problems, there’s even some indication that it can help the body to recover after serious conditions such as cancer.<br><br>
                        There are a lot of forces at play in conditions such as cancer, many of which we don’t fully understand, but there’s some evidence that indicates hiking might play a role in improving the antioxidative capacity in oncological patients.</p>

                    <div class="three__content-descr-text">This one depends a lot on how you approach hiking, and the way it fits into your own routine and lifestyle, but there’s a solid case to be made for the benefits of hiking on our social lives. One of the great things about hiking and walking as a hobby is that there are almost no restrictions on who can take part, and how they can go about it.

                    Hiking is one of the most natural, fulfilling things we can do. It puts us back in touch with the world we inhabit, it gives us a chance to exercise, bond with loved ones, and just breathe a bit. All the evidence is there – it’s not just hokum; hiking really does have tangible benefits.<br><br>
                    We’d love to hear about your own experiences, too. Have you found that hiking has had a particularly profound effect on one area of your life? Have you got any hiking experiences you’d like to share? Do you disagree with all of the above, and in fact believe that hiking is REALLY bad for us?
